:woman_technologist: Hi! My name is Mary. I'm learning backend development in Java. I love backend because I enjoy working on core application functions, being responsible for data processing, business logic, solving interesting problems, and then feeling the satisfaction of solving complex problems.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Java, SpringBoot and PostgreSQL.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on creating my own pet-projects just for fun and learning how to program.
- ðŸ˜€ I like to yoga, code, read, nature, and long walks.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I use Linux OS, like it a lot.
